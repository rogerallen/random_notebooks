* Random Jupyter Notebooks

Using this space to store random notebooks that I create while I
explore different ways of using Jupyter Notebooks.

I use Anaconda python to keep sane across Mac/Win/Linux.

* Codespace

I had to do this to get jupyter notebook running in the terminal.

jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://rogerallen-scaling-umbrella-jj9pqqv9p6c5prj-8888.preview.app.github.dev' --no-browser

I'm not sure how to get that origin except by starting it once, seeing the error and re-running.

Then click on the http://localhost:8888/?token=XXX URL
