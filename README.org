* Random Jupyter Notebooks

Using this space to store random notebooks that I create while I
explore different ways of using Jupyter Notebooks.

I use Anaconda python to keep sane across Mac/Win/Linux.

* License

These notebooks are in the public domain (or the equivalent where that
is not possible). You can do anything you want with them. You have no
legal obligation to do anything else, although I appreciate
attribution.
