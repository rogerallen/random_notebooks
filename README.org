* Random IPython Notebooks

Using this space to store random notebooks that I create while I
explore ipython.

I use Anaconda python to keep sane across Mac/Win/Linux

* Installation, Usage Notes

Every platform is different & this is how things work for me.

** Mac

Mac has its own python and making anaconda the default was problematic
in the past.

*** Update

#+begin_src sh
unset PYTHONPATH
set PATH=~/anaconda/bin/:$PATH

which python
# /Users/rallen/anaconda/bin/python

conda update conda
conda install anaconda=2.5
#+end_src sh

*** Run

#+begin_src sh
env PYTHONPATH= PATH=~/anaconda/bin/:$PATH ipython3 notebook
#+end_src sh

** PC

Update similar to Mac.  Both in C:/Anaconda and c:/Anaconda3

*** Run

In Git Bash:

#+begin_src sh
/c/Anaconda3/Scripts/ipython3.exe notebook
#+end_src sh

In Windows Command:

#+begin_src sh
C:\Anaconda3\Scripts\ipython3.exe notebook
#+end_src sh

** Linux

TBD

* License

These notebooks are in the public domain (or the equivalent where that
is not possible). You can do anything you want with them. You have no
legal obligation to do anything else, although I appreciate
attribution.
