* Random Jupyter Notebooks

Using this space to store random notebooks that I create while I
explore different ways of using Jupyter Notebooks.

I use Anaconda python to keep sane across Mac/Win/Linux.

* Codespace

I had to do this to get jupyter notebook running in the terminal.

Take note of the URL you are currently at running VS Code.  Something like `https://something-something-gobbledygook.github.dev`.  Then use part of that URL in the command below:

`jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://something-something-gobbledygook-8888.preview.app.github.dev' --no-browser`

Then click on the http://localhost:8888/?token=XXX URL 

* License

These notebooks are in the public domain (or the equivalent where that
is not possible). You can do anything you want with them. You have no
legal obligation to do anything else, although I appreciate
attribution.
